# Single-Phase-Double-Winding-XFR-and-Auto-XFR-using-Matlab-and-Simulink
Modelling of a single phase double winding transformer and autotransformer using SIMULINK

First of all run the 'transformerSelect.m' file and select the transformer. After selecting the XFR give the peramerters of XFR in the pop-up user interface. For plotting the voltage, current, power, press the button of plot of corresponding portion.
